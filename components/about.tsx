          Hello fellow friends, family and investors. My name is Kevin Kim and I
          want to say thank you for checking out my site! I am a Korean American
          who came to America with my family when I was 7 years old. From as far
          back as I can remember, my parents always told me life was better in
          America. A common refrain, no doubt heard by millions of other kids
          since. Eventually, I found out that all the stuff we learn are tools
          that when learned correctly, have the capacity to greatly improve our
          lives. As I learned more and became more adept at using some of these
          tools, I decided to write this blog to document my experiences and
          perspective on topics like stocks, real estate, life insurance, health
          savings and flex spending accounts and other investment vehicles.
          Youâ€™ll quickly come to find that not all of these tools are
          appropriate for everyone. Whatever tool or tools are right for you, I
          want to help teach you how to use them effectively so you can further
          enrich your life and start making your money work for you.
